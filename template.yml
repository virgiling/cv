      My research interests basically lie in the intersection of computer science and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on:

        - Cardinality Constraints in Satisfiability Solving
        - Parallel Algorithm in Satisfiability Solving
        - Combinatorial Optimization (e.g. Graph Theory)

      Recently, I also read some papers about LLM which are combining LLM with automated reasoning to solve complex problems.
